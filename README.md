# Auto Share
A peer to peer platform to rent cars from, and offer cars for rent. If you are a **car owner** looking to rent out your car for a short period of time, AutoShare provides you with a platform where you can list your car for rent, at specific dates and with an asked price. 
If you are looking to **rent** a car, AutoShare gives you the ability to easily look for cars available for rent, where and when you are interested.

## Motivation

  * Often times people who own cars find their cars parked and not going anywhere for extended periods of time. Wether it's because they went on vacation, started working from homeRoute or just dont go out as much as they used to. For others, they are interested in using their cars as a side buisiness, in order to make some extra money. There are also many people who find themselves wanting to go on spontanious trips, that require vehicles. But they dont want to pay the high prices rental companies charge. Or they find themselves in a situation where they need a car for a short time only, and renting a car would not be relevant. 
We want to help connect these two groups of people, bringing car owners and car renters together.
